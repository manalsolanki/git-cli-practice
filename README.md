# Assignment 
1. Assuming that you aren't sure whether you're currently inside of a Git repository, write the command (or commands) that will give you this information.
- ``` ls -a ```  (By this we can check whether  **.git** file is present or not.)
- ``` git status ``` (If repository is not intialized it would give the error.)
